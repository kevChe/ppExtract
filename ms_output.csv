GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1:
""
Marks must be awarded in line with:
""
• the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question
• the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question
• the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts.
GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2:
""
"Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions)."
GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3:
""
Marks must be awarded positively:
""
"• marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit"
"is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme,"
referring to your Team Leader as appropriate
• marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do
• marks are not deducted for errors
• marks are not deducted for omissions
"• answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these"
features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The
"meaning, however, should be unambiguous."
GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4:
""
"Rules must be applied consistently, e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed"
instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors.
GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5:
""
Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question
(however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate
responses seen).
GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6:
""
Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should
not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind.
